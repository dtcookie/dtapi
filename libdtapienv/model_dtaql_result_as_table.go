	// Corresponds to the amount of data used to fill the request. If the extrapolationLevel is 1, the response contains exact data. However, depending on your load and the selected timeframe, only a part of the data might be analyzed and the returned data is extrapolated. For example, extrapolationLevel: 4 means that only 1/4 of the data was used to fill your request. Usually this should be sufficient. If you really need exact data, you can split the timeframe into smaller pieces (in this, case 1/4 of the time).
	ExtrapolationLevel int32 `json:"extrapolationLevel,omitempty"`
	// A list of column names.
	ColumnNames []string `json:"columnNames,omitempty"`
	// A list of data rows, where each row is an array of objects. Object types depend on the query. The size of each data row and the order of the elements correspond to columnNames.
	Values [][]map[string]interface{} `json:"values,omitempty"`
